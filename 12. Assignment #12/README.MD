We decided to compare Russian and English words by their translation. There will be graphs. Each word in both languages will be compared layer by layer.

  + The space is divided by three parts.
  + There are two fields. The original sentence in English is written on the second part of the space. On the third part there is its translation in Russian.
  + Each word is a node of graph and links go downward.
  + There is a “+” (plus) sign near each word. When we click on it on the first part of the space information about the score of similarity of the Russian and English words appear.
    - If translation of words match each other, the rectangles become green, otherwise, red.
    - Around hyperonyms synsets appear. The matching between sysnets is compared in the same way.
